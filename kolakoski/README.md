# Kolakoski Sequences #

## Description ##

A Kolakoski sequence (A000002) is an infinite sequence of symbols {1, 2} that is its own run-length encoding. It alternates between "runs" of symbols. The sequence begins:
```
12211212212211211221211212211...
```

The first three symbols of the sequence are 122, which are the output of the first two iterations. After this, on the i-th iteration read the value x[i] of the output (one-indexed). If i is odd, output x[i] copies of the number 1. If i is even, output x[i] copies of the number 2.

There is an unproven conjecture that the density of 1s in the sequence is 1/2 (50%). In today's challenge we'll be searching for numerical evidence of this by tallying the ratio of 1s and 2s for some initial N symbols of the sequence.

## Input Description ##

As input you will receive the number of outputs to generate and tally.

## Output Description ##

As output, print the ratio of 1s to 2s in the first n symbols.

Sample Input
```
10
100
1000
```


Sample Output
```
5:5
49:51
502:498
```


## Challenge Input ##
```
1000000
100000000
```


## Bonus Hints ##

Since computing the next output in the sequence depends on previous outputs, a naive brute force approach requires O(n) space. For the last bonus input, this would amount to TBs of data, even if using only 1 bit per symbol. Fortunately there are smarter ways to compute the sequence (1, 2).
